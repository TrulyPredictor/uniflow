Instructions on Deploying:

Ensure you have a running Kubernetes cluster.

Apply the deployment YAML file using the following command:
kubectl apply -f uniflow-deployment.yaml

Monitor the deployment status:
kubectl get deployments

Ensure that the AVAILABLE column for your uniflow-deployment shows the desired number of replicas.

Expose the service if needed:
kubectl expose deployment uniflow-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --name=uniflow-service

Note: Adjust the service type based on your cluster environment (e.g., LoadBalancer, NodePort, etc.).

Access your Uniflow application using the exposed service's IP or hostname.
